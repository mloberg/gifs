# gifs

gifs I've collected throughout the years, available anywhere I need them.

## setup

* `bundle install --path=vendor/bundle --jobs=4 --retry=3`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## adding gifs

Use `bin/add` to add gifs. This optimizes the gif and creates a frame, which is
loaded and replaced when the gif fully loads.

## contributing

Feel free to open a PR to add a gif. I may accept it if I like it. You're probably
better off forking this repo and making it your own. You can deploy to Netlify,
but you have to clear cache anytime you add gifs due to LFS issues.
